# Presentation
Hey,  
Welcome to iBot's repository. I'm iDroid, the creator of the bot, in April 2017... I tried to found an alternative to the fabulous Spectra (made by [@jagrosh](https://github.com/jagrosh)), because it was kind of private, but unfortunately I did not find a good one. And I've got an idea: "What if I had my own all-in-one bot ?" and here came iBot.  
  
iBot is a Discord bot that is capable of doing various things such as moderation (kicking, warning, auto roles, etc), utility (getting information about a user, searching stuff on Google), fun commands (polls, a profile system...) and even a telephone with a numerotation system!
